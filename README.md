# Magento extension: Automated Cross Selling
### Your customers will be more informed and more confident in their purchase, immediately increasing sales.

Customers are also more likely to make a purchase decision when they see the path laid before them by other customers like themselves. "If it's good enough for her, then it's good enough for me!"

The **Automated Cross Selling** automatically tracks your customers shopping patterns, and then the extension turbo charges the results with proven cross-selling interface that's used by many of the top e-commerce sites on the planet.

By default the module retrieves the color patterns of your current theme.

**Multi-language ready!**
